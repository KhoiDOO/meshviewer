# Mesh Viewer for Research

A powerful 3D mesh and point cloud visualization toolkit built with OpenGL and Python. Load, inspect, and analyze 3D mesh and point cloud files with real-time rendering and comprehensive geometric analysis.

## Overview

This project provides two complementary visualization applications for 3D data research and analysis:

| Application | Purpose | Formats | Use Cases |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`main_mesh.py`** (Mesh Viewer) | Full topology analysis and mesh visualization | OBJ, STL, PLY, GLB, OFF | Mesh validation, defect detection, multi-mesh comparison |
| **`main_pc.py`** (Point Cloud Viewer) | Large-scale point cloud visualization | XYZ | LiDAR analysis, point cloud inspection, multi-cloud comparison |

## Getting Started

### Mesh Viewer
```bash
python main_mesh.py
# Press O to open a mesh file
# See docs/MESH_VIEWER.md for full documentation
```

### Point Cloud Viewer
```bash
python main_pc.py
# Press O to open a point cloud file
# See docs/POINT_CLOUD_VIEWER.md for full documentation
```

## Features at a Glance

### Mesh Viewer (main_mesh.py)
- ✅ Multi-mesh loading with automatic grid layout
- ✅ Topology analysis: self-intersections, non-manifold detection
- ✅ Visualization: face/vertex normals, point clouds, wireframe overlays
- ✅ Comprehensive mesh statistics in console output
- ✅ Side-by-side mesh comparison

### Point Cloud Viewer (main_pc.py)
- ✅ Multi-cloud loading with synchronized views
- ✅ GPU-optimized rendering for millions of points
- ✅ Support for colored point clouds (RGB)
- ✅ Adaptive point sizing and camera controls
- ✅ Multi-format support (XYZ, LAS, LAZ, PLY)

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- OpenGL 3.3+ capable graphics card
- 2GB+ RAM (4GB+ for large point clouds)

### Setup

**Platform-Specific Environment Setup:**

```bash
# For macOS
conda env create -f env_yaml/mac_env.yml
conda activate meshviewer

# For Windows
conda env create -f env_yaml/win_env.yml
conda activate meshviewer
```

**Or install dependencies manually:**
```bash
pip install glfw PyOpenGL numpy pyrr pillow trimesh python-fcl colorama
```
